# Cornell DTI Team Website
Website displaying all projects and members of Cornell Design & Tech Initiative.

## Getting Started
Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Once the repository is cloned onto your computer, run <code>npm install</code> in the project directory to install node modules. 

IntelliJ IDEA is the recommended IDE. Go to <code>File -> Settings -> Plugins</code> and search for <code>NodeJS</code>, clicking <code>Search in Repositories</code> when it appears. Install it. Javascript, HTML, and CSS plugins may also be helpful.

Run <code>npm start</code> in the project directory every time you wish to test the website changes locally.

React.js was installed into this repository by following [this](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) tutorial.
